This is the codebase for 15-418 project of implementing a lock-free extendible hash table.
This codebase will have implementation of coarse-grained, fine-grained, and lock-free implementation and a corresponding benchmark.
Note: Most of the base programs of this project is from https://github.com/cmu-db/bustub
The lock-free version is based on some hazard pointer implementation, and the split-order lists paper in paper/
